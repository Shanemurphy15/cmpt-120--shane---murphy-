def calculate_pi(n):
    '''
    This function calculates Pi using Leibniz's formula. The formula is calculated as
    the following:

        X = 4 - 4/1 + 4/3 - 4/5 + 4/7 - 4/9 + 4/11 - ...

    Notice the pattern within the formula. Please note that this series is never-ending
    and the higher value you pass in for n the closer the value of X converges to the value
    of Pi.

    Hint: 
        1. init your denominator k outside your loop.
        2. run a loop from 0 to n
        3. use mod inside the loop to determine whether to add or subtract 4/k
        4. increment k by 2
        5. repeat from step 2 until you reach end of range.

    @arg(n): the number of terms in the series to calculate (must be odd) (INCLUSIVE).
    @return: the calculated

    The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found
